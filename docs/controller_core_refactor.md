# ControllerCore refactor notes

## Target shape

The control brain must be shared by simulation and the real robot:

```text
Viewer / Control Station
  -> UDP or control API
  -> ControllerCore
  -> SimAdapter or RealAdapter
  -> MuJoCo or MagicBot SDK
```

`ControllerCore` owns observation construction, ONNX policy execution, mode requests,
motion safety, target limiting, gains, and telemetry. Adapters only translate between
backend I/O and `RobotSnapshot` / `JointTarget`.

## Current reusable pieces

- `magicbot_loco_core.h` already contains the shared `RobotSnapshot`, `LocoConfig`,
  `OnnxLocoPolicy`, `MotionSafety`, target torque limiting, joint limit clipping,
  and rate limiting utilities.
- `magicbot_loco_sdk_adapter.h` is already a real-robot I/O boundary for SDK state
  and command publication.
- `dual_inference_rate.cpp`, `mujoco_loco_viewer.cpp`, and
  `magicbot_z1_loco_onnx.cpp` currently duplicate parts of the LOCO step:
  projected gravity, ONNX inference, safety checks, torque limiting, and command
  target rate limiting.

## First refactor cut

`controller_core.h` introduces the shared data contract:

- `Command`
- `ModeRequest`
- `JointTarget`
- `JointGains`
- `ControllerTelemetry`
- `ControllerCore`

`mode_manager.h` owns shared mode state and transition metadata for
`PASSIVE`, `STAND`, `LOCO`, and `FINAL_DAMPING`. It marks transitions that must
reset policy history, zero commands, or seed targets from the current robot
state. `DANCE` and `SKILL` remain explicit modes but are rejected until a skill
policy adapter is installed.

`robot_adapter.h` introduces the backend boundary:

- `RobotAdapter::read_snapshot()`
- `RobotAdapter::write_target()`
- `RobotAdapter::write_damping()`
- `AdapterTelemetry`

Concrete adapters must keep backend details local. A MuJoCo adapter may include
MuJoCo headers in its `.cpp`; a real adapter may include MagicBot SDK headers in
its `.cpp`; neither side should put those details into `ControllerCore`.

`magicbot_real_adapter.h` is the first concrete adapter. It wraps the existing
`MagicbotSdkAdapter` and `SdkRobotState`, translating shared `JointTarget`
outputs into SDK low-level commands or damping commands. It deliberately does
not inspect mode requests, run policies, or perform safety checks.

`mujoco_sim_adapter.h` is the first concrete sim adapter. It reads MuJoCo
`qpos` / `qvel` into `RobotSnapshot` and writes `JointTarget` as PD torques into
`mjData::ctrl`. It does not step the simulation, handle viewer input, or run
policy logic.

`dual_inference_rate.cpp` now routes its pure-sim and real-state-sim LOCO policy
step through `ControllerCore`. It remains a validation tool only and still never
publishes commands to the real robot.

The first `ControllerCore` implementation supports `PASSIVE`, `STAND`, `LOCO`,
and `FINAL_DAMPING`. `DANCE` and `SKILL` are represented in the shared mode enum
but intentionally reject requests until the skill policy adapter is wired.

This keeps the real-robot safety ladder intact: high-risk LOCO still requires
the existing CLI `--allow-loco` gate, and adapters remain responsible only for
state/command I/O.

## Next cuts

1. Route `magicbot_z1_loco_onnx` LOCO loop through `ControllerCore`.
2. Route MuJoCo viewer closed-loop code through `MujocoSimAdapter` and the same
   `ControllerCore` API.
3. Add policy adapters for `DANCE` / `SKILL`.
4. Move viewer mode/control API code to send requests only; it must not duplicate
   core policy or safety logic.
